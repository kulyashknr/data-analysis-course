Lu\\n2, X. Liu\\n3 and C. Liu\\n4 University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 760\\n19 \\n   \\nThe goal of this work is to develop a new universal\\n high order subroutine for shock \\nboundary layer interaction. First, an effective sho\\nck/discontinuity detector has been \\ndeveloped. The detector has two steps. The first st\\nep is to check the ratio of the truncation \\nerrors on the coarse and fine grids and the second \\nstep is to check the local ratio of the left \\nand right slopes. The currently popular shock/disco\\nntinuity detectors such as Harten™s, \\nJameson™s and WENO can detect shock, but mistake hig\\nh frequency waves and critical \\npoints as shock and then damp the physically import\\nant high frequency waves. Preliminary \\nresults show the new shock/discontinuity detector i\\ns very delicate and can detect all shocks \\nincluding strong, weak and oblique shocks or discon\\ntinuity in function and the first, second, \\nand third order derivatives without artificial cons\\ntants, but never mistake high frequency \\nwaves and critical points, expansion waves as shock\\n. This will overcome the bottle neck \\nproblem with numerical simulation for the shock-bou\\nndary layer interaction, shock-acoustic \\ninteraction, image process, porous media flow, mult\\niple phase flow and anywhere the high \\nfrequency waves are important, but discontinuity ex\\nists and is mixed with high frequency \\nwaves. After detecting the shock we can then use on\\ne side high order scheme for shocks and \\nhigh order central compact scheme for the rest if t\\nhe shock is appropriately located. Then a \\nhigh order universal subroutine for finite differen\\nce method is developed which can be used \\nfor any finite difference code for accurate numeric\\nal derivatives. \\nNomenclature \\nE, F, G\\n = Fluxes in Nevier-Stokes Equations \\n = Curvilinear Coordinates \\nIS\\n = WENO smoothness \\nf                =    Input function \\nPu,,r = Density, velocity, and pressure \\nT = Truncation Error \\nt = Time \\ni = Index in x-direction \\nI.\\n Introduction \\n 1.1 Importance of Shock/discontinuity detector \\n\\nThe high order compact finite difference scheme (Le\\nle 1992) has been widely applied for numerical simu\\nlation of \\nflow transition, turbulence, acoustic problems, and\\n many other places where the high order accuracy an\\nd high \\nresolution is important. However, the high order co\\nmpact scheme will meet severe trouble when the \\nshock/discontinuity occurs in the computational dom\\nain since the continuity in function and/or derivat\\nives are lost \\nand the classical numerical analysis, which is base\\nd on an assumption that the subject function is con\\ntinuous in \\nfunction and any order of derivatives, will all fai\\nl. Therefore, an effective shock/discontinuity dete\\nctor which can \\ndetect any shock including strong shock, weak shock\\n, oblique shock or discontinuity in function, first\\n order \\n                                                   \\n       \\n 1 PhD student, Department of Mathematics, Box 19408,\\n UTA, Arlington, TX 76019. \\n2 PhD student, Department of Mathematics, Box 19408,\\n UTA, Arlington, TX 76019. \\n3 PhD student, Department of Mathematics, Box 19408,\\n UTA, Arlington, TX 76019. \\n4 Professor, Department of Mathematics, Box 19408, U\\nTA, Arlington, TX 76019, AIAA Associate Fellow. \\n zhx,,47th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting Including The New Horizons Forum and Aerospace Exposition5 - 8 January 2009, Orlando, FloridaAIAA 2009-1139Copyright © 2009 by Chaoqun Liu.

American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics \\n092407  2 derivative, second order derivative, etc., is criti\\ncal to the success of numerical simulation for shoc\\nk-turbulence \\ninteraction, shock-acoustic interaction, porous med\\nia flow, multiple phase flow, image process, etc., \\nwhere both \\nshock and high frequency waves are important.  Rece\\nntly, many different numerical methods have been us\\ned to \\naccomplish this, with combinations of high order nu\\nmerical schemes and filters (Martin, 2007; Visbal &\\n Gaitonde, \\n2002; Jiang et al, 2001).  The application of low-o\\nrder filters on areas with shock waves to remove no\\nn-physical \\nwiggles can achieve success only when the shock loc\\nator can give the right locations for shock/discont\\ninuity.  \\nTherefore, the development of an effective shock lo\\ncator is critical. \\n \\nThe current popular shock/discontinuity detectors i\\nncluding Harten™s (1978), Jameson™s (1981), WENO (1\\n996) use \\nfirst derivatives and/or second order derivatives o\\nf the function to detect shock. They can detector \\nshock/discontinuity effectively, but mistake high f\\nrequency sinuous functions and critical point as sh\\nock since the \\nfirst derivative is high for high frequency waves a\\nnd the second order derivative is high for critical\\n points. How to \\ndistinguish shock/discontinuity from high frequency\\n waves and critical points was though extremely dif\\nficult if not \\nimpossible. There are many new efforts (Zhou et al,\\n 2007; Cueto-Felguerroso et al 2007; Archibald et a\\nl, 2008) on \\nthis challenging topic. \\n\\n \\nUnlike other shock locators, this effort is to deve\\nlop a very efficient shock detector which can detec\\nt any strong or \\nweak discontinuity in function, first order, second\\n order, and third order derivatives, but never mist\\nakes high \\nfrequency sinuous functions as shock at reasonable \\ncost in computation. With preliminary successes for\\n 9 test cases \\nfor the high frequency waves, mixed high frequency \\nwave with discontinuity, large slope smooth functio\\nn, shock \\ntube, and shock-entropy interactions, the new two s\\ntep shock detector has not found any particular cas\\ne which can \\nmake the new detector fail. \\n\\n \\nThis new shock detector is a two step check with gl\\nobal multilevel grids truncation error ratio check \\nand local left \\nand right slope ratio check (details can be found i\\nn the following sections).  \\n \\nAfter we detect shock, we can use high order centra\\nl compact scheme for the smooth part, but one side \\nhigh order \\nscheme for the shock/discontinuity or low order fil\\nter for the shock area to eliminate adjunct wiggles\\n around the \\nshock.  \\n\\n \\n1.2 Fundamental tasks for finite difference methods\\n   \\n\\nThe fundamental task of finite difference methods f\\nor ODE or PDE is to provide an accurate approximati\\non of \\nderivatives for a given discrete data set. Traditio\\nnal finite difference schemes such as central or up\\n-winding schemes \\nare developed based on analysis of physics, for exa\\nmple, central for elliptic and up-winding for hyper\\nbolic \\nproblems. On the other hand, the computer does not \\nknow physics. It only accepts a set of discrete dat\\na as an input \\nand gives back a set of discrete data as output der\\nivatives, without consideration of the problems pot\\nentially \\nstemming from fluid dynamics, biology or social sci\\nence. Therefore, our efforts are focused on how to \\nprovide an \\naccurate derivative for a given data set.  To do th\\nis, we have to first detect the shock/discontinuity\\n and then use the \\none side high order scheme for shock and high order\\n central scheme for the smooth part. \\n \\n1.3 Importance of high order scheme to DNS/LES \\n\\n \\nIt should be pointed out that the order of accuracy\\n of a finite difference scheme is absolutely not a \\ntrivial issue to \\nCFD, especially to direct numerical simulation (DNS\\n) and large eddy simulation (LES). There is a big d\\nifference in \\nrequirements of grid size by DNS/LES between low or\\nder schemes and high order schemes. Let us take a l\\nook at the \\nlocal truncation error for 1-D problem. If one uses\\n a second order scheme with a mesh size of \\n2xDand wants to \\nhave the same truncation error as a sixth order sch\\neme with a mesh size of \\n6xD, one should have:  \\n666222)()(xCxCD=D.                                                  \\n                                                   \\n                    (1.1) \\nAssume \\n62CC»and \\n01.0\\n6=Dx(100 grid points in a normalized domain), we will g\\net \\n6222)10(\\n)(-=Dx, \\n6210\\n-=Dx.                                                  \\n                                                   \\n                                       (1.2)  \\nIn other words, the second order scheme needs one m\\nillion of grid points to beat the sixth order schem\\ne with 100 \\ngrid points for the same accuracy. This advantage o\\nf high order scheme will become more significant wh\\nen one uses \\n American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics \\n092407 \\n 3 DNS for 3-D problems. We cannot use, and do not wan\\nt to use, millions of grids in each direction for D\\nNS, but \\nprefer to use 100 grid points. Therefore the high o\\nrder scheme must be used. Of course, the global err\\nor does not \\nonly depend on the local truncation error and \\n62CC¹. The advantage of the sixth order scheme does not \\nshow 10 \\nthousand times better than the second order scheme.\\n However, it is now widely recognized that high ord\\ner finite \\ndifference schemes are strongly encouraged to be us\\ned for DNS and LES which have much higher accuracy \\nand \\nhigher resolution with the same grid size than low \\norder schemes do.  \\n \\n1.4 New point of view on high order CFD \\n\\n \\nThe 3-D time dependent Navier-Stokes equations in a\\n general curvilinear coordinate can be written as  \\n \\n \\n                                                   \\n                              .                    \\n                                                   \\n         (1.3) \\nFor 1-D conservation law, it will be: \\n\\n \\n \\n                                                   \\n                                                   \\n                                                   \\n        (1.4) \\nThe critical issue for high order CFD is to find an\\n accurate approximation of derivatives for a given \\ndiscrete data set. \\nThe computer does not know any physical process but\\n rather a discrete data set. The output derivative \\nis also a \\ndiscrete data set. For three dimensional problems, \\nwe only need to call the universal subroutine three\\n times. \\n \\n1.5 A short overview on shock capturing schemes \\n\\n \\nThe flow field is in general governed by the Navier\\n-Stokes system. In the smooth region of solutions, \\nthe Navier-\\nStokes system presents parabolic type behavior and \\nis therefore dominated by viscosity or second order\\n derivatives. \\nOne expects that the equation should be solved by t\\nhe high order central difference scheme, high order\\n compact \\nscheme is preferable, to get high order accuracy an\\nd high resolution. High order of accuracy is critic\\nal in resolving \\nsmall length scales in the flow transition and turb\\nulence process. However, for external flow, the vis\\ncosity is \\nimportant largely only in the boundary layers. The \\nmain flow can still be considered as inviscid and t\\nhe governing \\nsystem can be dominated by the time dependent Euler\\n equations which are hyperbolic. The difficult prob\\nlem with \\nthe numerical solution is shock capturing which can\\n be considered as a discontinuity or mathematical s\\ningularity (no \\nclassical unique solution and no bounded derivative\\ns). In the shock area, continuity and differentiabi\\nlity of the \\ngoverning Euler equations are lost and only the wea\\nk solution in an integration form can be obtained. \\nThe shock can \\nbe developed because the Euler equation is non-line\\nar and hyperbolic. For the hyperbolic system, the a\\nnalysis \\nalready shows the existence of characteristic lines\\n and Riemann invariants. Apparently, the upwind fin\\nite difference \\nscheme coincides with the physics for a hyperbolic \\nsystem. History has shown the great success of upwi\\nnd \\ntechnologies. Many upwind or bias upwind schemes ha\\nve achieved great success in capturing the shocks s\\nharply, \\nsuch as Godnov (1959), Roe (1981), MUSCL (Van Leer,\\n 1979), TVD (Harten, 1983), ENO (Harten et al, 1987\\n; Shu \\net al, 1988, 1989) and WENO (Liu et al, 1994; Jiang\\n et al, 1996). However, all these shock-capturing s\\nchemes are \\nbased on upwind or bias upwind technology, which is\\n nice for a hyperbolic system, but is not favorable\\n to the N-S \\nsystem which presents parabolic equation behavior. \\nThe small length scale is very important in the flo\\nw transition \\nand turbulence process and thus very sensitive to a\\nny artificial numerical dissipation. High order com\\npact scheme \\n(Lele, 1992; Visble, 2002) is more appropriate for \\nsimulation of flow transition and turbulence becaus\\ne it is central \\nand non-dissipative with high order accuracy and hi\\ngh resolution. Due to the usage of derivatives, com\\npact schemes \\nusually give us a tri-diagonal or penta-diagonal sy\\nstem. Although the tri-diagonal matrix is sparse, t\\nhe inverse of a \\ntri-diagonal matrix is dense, which means the deriv\\native at a certain grid point depends upon all the \\ngrid points along \\na grid line. The success of compact schemes indicat\\nes that the global dependency is very important for\\n high \\nresolution. However, the global dependency is good \\nfor resolution but not so applicable for shock capt\\nuring. \\n The basic idea proposed in ENO (Harten et al, 1987)\\n and WENO (Jiang et al, 1996) schemes is to avoid t\\nhe stencil \\ncontaining a shock. ENO chooses the smoothest stenc\\nil from several candidates to calculate the derivat\\nives. WENO \\ncontrols the contributions of different stencils ac\\ncording to their smoothness. In this way, the deriv\\native at a certain \\ngrid point, especially one near the shock, is depen\\ndent on a very limited number of grid points. The l\\nocal \\ndependency here is favorable for shock capturing an\\nd helps to obtain the non-oscillatory property. The\\n success of \\nENO and WENO schemes indicates that the local depen\\ndency is critical for shock capturing. \\n()()()01=¶-¶+¶-¶+¶-¶+¶¶zhxvvvGGFFEEtQJ0=¶¶+¶¶xEtQ American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics \\n092407 \\n 4  \\nApparently, the critical point is to find the exact\\n location of the shock/discontinuity, or, in other \\nwords, to develop a \\nvery effective shock/discontinuity locator.

Apparently, shock is sharper and expansi\\non wave deformation is removed.\\n  Figure 10 WENO for 1-D shock tube (T=2, grid=100)  \\n American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics \\n092407 \\n 11\\n    \\n Figure 11 Modified WCS vs WENO for 1-D shock tube (\\nT=2 and grids=100) \\n \\n2) Shock-entropy interaction \\n\\n \\nTo test the capability of the new scheme in both sh\\nock capturing and resolution, we applied it to the \\n1-D problem of \\nshock/entropy wave interaction. In this case, Euler\\n equations (4.1) are solved with the following init\\nial conditions: \\n()\\n()()\\n-³+-<=.4\\n1,0\\n),\\n5sin(\\n2.0\\n1;4\\n,33333\\n.10,\\n629369\\n.2\\n,857143\\n.3\\n,,0xxxpur                                                   \\n                (4.3) \\nOn a coarser grid with grid number of N=200, the MW\\nCS (LJX) scheme shows much better resolution for sm\\nall \\nlength scales than the 5\\nth\\n order WENO (Figure 12 (a), (b)). This is because M\\nWCS uses central, non-dissipative, \\ncompact scheme with weights near the shock area and\\n recovers high order compact right off the shock. T\\nhe \\nnumerical results by our MWCS scheme with 200 grid \\npoints are even comparable with the 5\\nth\\n order WENO scheme \\nwith 1600 grid points (Figure 12 (b)). \\n American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics \\n092407 \\n 12\\n                                     (a) \\n \\n       \\n (b) \\nFigure 12 Numerical test for 1D shock-entropy wave \\ninteraction problem, t=1.8, N=200.

The Reynolds number is \\n510\\nand \\nthe Mach number was set to 2.15. The overall pressu\\nre ratio is 1.55. For comparison, the inflow condit\\nion was set as \\nsame investigated by Degrez et al (1987). Their exp\\nerimental work has shown the shock-boundary layer i\\nnteraction \\nis laminar and two-dimensional. Therefore, we can d\\no a 2-D numerical simulation and compare with their\\n \\ncomputational and experimental results. The computa\\ntional grids is 257x257 (Figure 14). The grid stret\\nching in \\nstremwise direction is 1.01. The stretching in norm\\nal direction is 1.015. A 2-D Navier-Stokes equation\\n is solved as \\nthe governing equation.  \\n\\n    \\n               \\n Figure  13 Sketch of incident shock-boundary layer \\ninteraction      Figure 14 Computation Grids (257x2\\n57) \\n American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics \\n092407 \\n 13\\n  Figure 15   Pressure distribution: left is a normal\\n view and right is stretched in the normal directio\\nn by a factor of 5 \\n Figure 16  Density distribution: left is a normal v\\niew and right is stretched in the normal direction \\nby a factor of 5 \\n \\n   \\nFigure  17 Comparison of pressure distribution on t\\nhe wall surface.

The first o\\nrder derivative is large for high frequency waves a\\nnd the \\nsecond order derivative is large for critical point\\ns. Both Harten™s and WENO treat them as shock. Howe\\nver, Our \\nnew two step shock detector considers high order de\\nrivatives, fine (h) and  coarse grids (2h), high or\\nder \\ntruncation error ratios and local left and right an\\ngle ratios.  \\n Our two step shock detector never missed any shock/\\ndiscontinuity including strong shock, weak shock, o\\nblique \\nshock and, moreover, never took high frequecy waves\\n as shock to smear.  Therefore, we believe we are i\\nn a very \\npromissing position to solve the most chalenging pr\\noblem - to develop an effective shock/discontinuity\\n locator. This \\ntopic is particularly important to shock-turbulence\\n interaction, shock acoustic interaction, image pro\\ncess, porous \\nmedia flow, multiple phase flow, etc. where both sh\\nock/discontinuity and small length scales are impor\\ntant.  \\n VI.\\n Acknowledgement \\n This work was supported by US AFOSR Grant FA9550-05\\n-1-0136 supervised by Dr. Fariba Fahroo and Air For\\nce \\nVA Summer Faculty Research Program supervised by Dr\\n.
